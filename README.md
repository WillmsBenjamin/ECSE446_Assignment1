### Basic rendering exercise for Ray Tracing and Rasterization
### Note that this repo does not include all of the code necessary to run the renderer, only those files which the student was allowed to interact with directly.

Shading is done by taking the absolute value of the normal.

Students were to implement just the Ray Tracing rendering loop, and the shaders and some opengl calls for Rasterization

For Ray Tracing, I implemented the bonus question which required sampling a set number of rays per pixel at random locations on the pixel
